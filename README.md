# Numerical Optimization Notes

Broadly Numerical Optimizations can be divided into 3 categories:
Descent methods : adapted to convex cost functions
 - steepest descent, 
 - conjugate gradient, 
 - quasi-Newton, 
 - Newton, etc.
Evolutionary methods : adapted to multi-modal cost functions
 - genetic algorithms, 
 - evolution strategies, 
 - particle swarm, 
 - ant colony, 
 - simulated annealing, etc.
Pattern search methods : adapted to noisy cost functions
 - Nelder-Mead simplex, 
 - Torczonâ€™s multidirectional search, etc.
