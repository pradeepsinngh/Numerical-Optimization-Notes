# Numerical Optimization Notes

Broadly Numerical Optimizations can be divided into 3 categories:
Descent methods : adapted to convex cost functions
- steepest descent, 
- conjugate gradient, 
- quasi-Newton, 
- Newton, etc.
Evolutionary methods : adapted to multi-modal cost functions
- genetic algorithms, 
- evolution strategies, 
- particle swarm, 
- ant colony, 
- simulated annealing, etc.
Pattern search methods : adapted to noisy cost functions
- Nelder-Mead simplex, 
- Torczon’s multidirectional search, etc.
